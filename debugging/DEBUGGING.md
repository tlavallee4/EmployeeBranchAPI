# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Environment Variable Management

- **Breakpoint Location:** src/app.ts, Line 6
- **Objective:** Verify that environment variables are loaded using dotenv and API keys is managed.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:** 
  - dotenv_1 (indicating that dotenv is loaded)
- **Call Stack:** 
  - Pauses at dotenv.config(), is being read.
- **Behavior:** 
  - The application loads the environment variables from .env before other services.

### Analysis

- **Learnings:**
  - The .env file is being read, and dotenv is configured.
- **Unexpected Behavior:**
  - No errors.
- **Improvements:**
  - .env.example is included in the repository to guide other developers on required variables.
- **Project Understanding:**
  - Securely managing environment variables for sensitive data like API keys.


## Scenario 2: Helmet.js Security Headers

- **Breakpoint Location:** src/app.ts, Line 27
- **Objective:** Helmet.js is correctly setting security headers for XSS protection and clickjacking prevention.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**  
  - helmet_1 = {default: f{}}, indicating that Helmet is imported and ready for use.
- **Call Stack:**  
  - The debugger shows execution reaching the helmet() function, confirming that security headers are applied.
- **Behavior:**  
  - contentSecurityPolicy is configured to restrict script sources (script-src: ['self']).
  - frameguard: confirms that clickjacking protection is active.

### Analysis

- **Learnings:**
  - Helmet.js is correct, applying security headers as expected.
- **Unexpected Behavior:**
  - No errors, meaning the security middleware is working without blocking requests.
- **Improvements:**
  - Logging headers to verify Postman.
- **Project Understanding:**
  - Helmet.js strengthens security for XSS and clickjacking.


## Scenario 3: OpenAPI Documentation Integration

- **Breakpoint Location:** config/swagger.ts, Line 9
- **Objective:** Swagger UI properly generates and serves API documentation.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**  
  - specs = openapi: '3.0.0',  OpenAPI specification is being generated
- **Call Stack:**  
  - Execution pauses before app.use("/api-docs", swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(specs)), API documentation setup process.
- **Behavior:**  
  - Swagger loads the OpenAPI spec, making API documentation available at /api-docs.

### Analysis

- **Learnings:**
  - OpenAPI specification is correctly being generated into Swagger UI.
- **Unexpected Behavior:**
  - No errors indicate that Swagger is successfully processing the OpenAPI JSON file
- **Improvements:**
  - Confirm the /api-docs endpoint is accessible after server startup
- **Project Understanding:**
  - OpenAPI allows developers to explore and test the API directly from the browser.
