# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Updating a branch

-   **Breakpoint Location:** [File and line number]
-   **Objective:** [What you are investigating or trying to understand]

### Debugger Observations

-   **Variable States:** [List key variables and their values]
-   **Call Stack:** [Summarize the function sequence leading to the breakpoint]
-   **Behavior:** [Describe what happens at this point in the program]

### Analysis

-   What did you learn from this scenario?
-   Did you observe any unexpected behavior? If so, what might be the cause?
-   Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?
-   How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?

## Scenario 2: Getting Employees by branch

-   **Breakpoint Location:** [File and line number]
-   **Objective:** [What you are investigating or trying to understand]

### Debugger Observations

-   **Variable States:** [List key variables and their values]
-   **Call Stack:** [Summarize the function sequence leading to the breakpoint]
-   **Behavior:** [Describe what happens at this point in the program]
